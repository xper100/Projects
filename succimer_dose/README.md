1. 프로젝트 개요
The researchers were conducted with 120 children aged 12 divided into two groups; one is less than 24
months (ind.age = 0) and the other is more than 24 months (ind.age = 1) after confirmed blood lead levels of >
15μg/dL and <40μg/dL. For gender, male is assigned to be 0 while female is 1. Also, randomly assigned 40 children
to three different treatment groups: placebo, low dose of succimer, and high dose of succimer. Setting up the
baseline (time 0) before assigning treatment, blood lead level of each subject was measured at weeks 0, 2,4,6 and 8.
The objective is 1) to evaluate how much each treatment’s effect differ across gender and age, and 2) to figure out
which treatment helps the most to excrete the lead that has been injected. Following outputs are provided by R
programming languag. The details of variables are given in table 1.

| 변수명 | 값 |
|---|---|
|Blood | 혈중 납 농도 (0.5 ~ 48.3μg/dL) 
|trt | Treatment; Placebo = 1, 적은 양의 Succimer = 2, and 많은 양의 Succimer = 3
| Week | 방문한 주 ; 0,2,4,6 and 8 (숫자형)
|Ind.age | 24개월 이하 = 0 & 24개월 초과 = 1
| Sex | Male = 0 & Female = 1
